Project Aims: To create my first React app, using both fetch requests, rendering components via React and functionality via at least 2-3 mini-features. I spent 4 days working on it, amidst doing codecademy's front-end-development certifcation exams, so there were some features which I would have liked to spend more time on.

What I liked about the final result:
- I was able to complete my first fetch request from the Reddit API
- The searchbar worked as expected and correctly filtered the results
- The code was fairly clean, due to importing other components
- The like buttons / total like buttons functionality
- The layout was consistent

Areas of improvement / issues encountered:
- Although the searchbar worked, I was unable to link it to the API fetch request, instead opting for hard coded data. It would've been better to spend more time on attempting several reddit API requests (for the top posts and subreddits) and trying to link the searchbar feature to those fetched results
- The like buttons were initially meant to run up a total likes / dislikes counter on each top post, however on changing one of them they all changed. If I did the project again I would try to link the like buttons to each individual fetch request (e.g. top posts, memes, subreddits) so it could work separately.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
